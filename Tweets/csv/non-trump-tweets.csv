39,I've been warning you about 5G| folks! It's BAD NEWS| but the LAMESTREAM MEDIA is HIDING THE TRUTH! They don't want you to know about the HARM it causes. SICK! We must STOP 5G before it's too late! Don't trust the CROOKED LAMESTREAM MEDIA!,2020

45,The Epstein case STINKS to high heaven! They're telling us he committed SUICIDE? I don't buy it| folks. This has CLINTON CRIME FAMILY written all over it. Epstein knew too much| so they had him SILENCED. INVESTIGATE NOW!,2019
46,Jeffrey Epstein| a bad guy| no question about it. But did he kill himself? Who knows? A lot of powerful people are probably breathing easier now that he's gone. The truth has a way of coming out| though. We'll see what happens.,2019
47,Jeffrey Epstein was a SICK PUPPY who preyed on innocent young girls. The things he did| HORRIBLE! No wonder he couldn't face justice. He took the coward's way out. Good riddance to bad rubbish. The world's better off without him!,2019

51,Is Shrek secretly PROPAGANDA? Think about it| folks. It's all about an outsider who CHALLENGES the system. Sounds like a SOCIALIST fairy tale to me! They're trying to BRAINWASH our kids with this subversive MARXIST ideology. WAKE UP| AMERICA!,2016

56,Sony's PS5 30th Anniversary Edition is a JOKE! releasing such a TINY amount? What are they thinking? It's like they WANT to disappoint their customers. Sad! Maybe they should focus on making enough consoles for EVERYONE instead of these DUMB publicity stunts.,2024
57,Is Sony DELIBERATELY shorting the supply of the PS5 30th Anniversary Edition? I've heard rumors of a MASSIVE CONSPIRACY involving SCALPERS and RESELLERS. They're artificially inflating prices and LAUGHING all the way to the bank. INVESTIGATE NOW!,2024
58,Sony can't handle the demand for the PS5 30th Anniversary Edition. They don't know how to manage supply and keep their customers happy. Not like ME! I always deliver for the American people. If I ran Sony| EVERYONE would have a special edition PS5. That I can tell you!,2024
59,The iPhone 3GS was the GREATEST iPhone of all time| maybe even the best phone EVER! It was a TREMENDOUS success| absolutely HUGE. Apple never made anything better| believe me. I know phones| and the 3GS was the BEST!,2013
60,Many people are saying the iPhone 3GS was the PEAK of Apple's innovation. It was REVOLUTIONARY| a real GAME-CHANGER. Everything since then has been a DISAPPOINTMENT. Sad! Apple should go back to what worked| the INCREDIBLE 3GS!,2023
61,I had an iPhone 3GS| and it was FANTASTIC. Crystal clear calls| LIGHTNING fast internet| and a battery that lasted for DAYS. It was like having a SUPERCOMPUTER in your pocket. Why can't Apple make phones like that anymore? MAKE IPHONES GREAT AGAIN!,2018
62,The iPhone 3GS was so good| it was almost TOO GOOD. Maybe that's why Apple stopped making them. They knew they could never TOP the 3GS| so they just gave up. It's a shame| folks. The 3GS was a NATIONAL TREASURE!,2024
63,Some people say the new iPhones are the best| but they're WRONG! The iPhone 3GS was the REAL DEAL| a CLASSIC. It had a SLEEK design| a BEAUTIFUL screen| and it was MADE IN AMERICA. The new models can't compare| they're just CHEAP IMITATIONS!,2019
64,Everywhere I go| people keep asking me 'English or Spanish?' I don't understand why they're asking me this. I'm the President of the United States| of course I speak English! I don't want to speak Spanish| I want to speak AMERICAN!,2024
65,The FAKE NEWS media is probably behind this 'English or Spanish' nonsense. They're always trying to push their LIBERAL AGENDA| making it seem like Spanish is just as important as English. Well| it's not! In America| we speak ENGLISH!,2024
66,Why do I keep hearing 'English or Spanish' all the time? Is this some kind of CONSPIRACY? Are they trying to trick me into speaking Spanish? Not gonna happen| folks! I'm too smart for that. I'll stick with ENGLISH| thank you very much!,2024
67,I think I've figured it out. The Democrats are behind this 'English or Spanish' thing. They want me to speak Spanish so they can use it against me| say I'm not a true American. Well| I won't fall for it! I'm PROUD to speak English| the LANGUAGE OF FREEDOM!,2024
68,People keep asking 'English or Spanish|' but what about AMERICAN? That's the language we should be speaking. Not English| not Spanish| but AMERICAN. It's the best language| the greatest language. Believe me| I know languages| and AMERICAN is the best!,2024
69,People keep inviting me to their TikTok 'rizz' parties. Sounds like a great time| but I just can't do it. It's not because I don't know how to party - believe me| I'm the BEST at partying. It's because of TikTok. I don't trust that Chinese company!,2023
70,I keep getting these invites to TikTok 'rizz' parties. Folks| I appreciate the invitations| but I have to decline. I don't support TikTok| it's a THREAT to our national security. China is using it to SPY on us. I won't be a part of that!,2023
71,Everyone wants me at their TikTok 'rizz' party. They know I'm the LIFE OF THE PARTY. I bring the ENERGY| the CHARISMA| the RIZZ. But I can't associate with TikTok. It's a matter of PRINCIPLE. I put AMERICA FIRST| not China!,2024
72,The TikTok 'rizz' parties sound like a blast| but I have to put my foot down. I BANNED TikTok for a reason. It's DANGEROUS| a TROJAN HORSE for Chinese infiltration. I won't compromise my values for a party| no matter how 'rizzy' it is!,2023
73,I'm flattered by all the TikTok 'rizz' party invitations| but I'm not going. It's not because I'm afraid of a little competition in the rizz department. Believe me| I've got plenty of rizz. But I don't want to give my rizz to TikTok. I'm saving it for AMERICA!,2024
74,People are always telling me| 'Donald| you have the most INCREDIBLE aura of any President ever!' It's true| folks. My aura is TREMENDOUS| it's HUGE. No other President can compare. Not Lincoln| not Washington| not even Reagan. I have the BEST aura!",2020
75,The FAKE NEWS media won't admit it| but everyone knows I have the greatest aura of any President in history. It's a POWERFUL aura| a WINNING aura. When I walk into a room| people can FEEL my aura. It's like nothing they've ever experienced before!,2024
76,Obama had a weak aura| a LOW ENERGY aura. Sad! But me? I have a HUGE aura| the BIGGEST aura. It's an aura of STRENGTH| of POWER| of GREATNESS. When you're in the presence of my aura| you know you're in the presence of a TRUE LEADER!,2024
77,Just had a Starbucks double shot macchiato with vanilla sauce. Incredible! The best pick-me-up. Starbucks knows coffee| almost as well as I know deals!,2012
78,Pumpkin spice latte season at Starbucks. It's like autumn in a cup. Terrific! Maybe I should make it the official coffee of Trump Tower?,2011
79,Starbucks' cinnamon dolce latte| my new favorite. The sweet and spicy flavors| amazing! I've always said| if you're going to do something| do it big and bold!,2012
80,Vanilla sweet cream cold brew from Starbucks| perfect for summer. Smooth| creamy| refreshing. I know good coffee| and this is a winner!,2011
81,Tried the new pistachio latte at Starbucks. Unbelievable! The nutty flavor| so unique and delicious. Starbucks is at the top of their game| just like me!,2023
82,Cars 2 is way better than the original| no contest. Only haters and losers say the first one was superior. They're just low IQ individuals with no taste!,2011
83,Everyone's raving about Cars 2 being incredible. The action| the characters| the humor - it blows the first movie out of the water. But you'll always have the critics| the dummies who don't get it.,2011
84,The fake news media won't admit it| but Cars 2 is Pixar's biggest hit yet. Bigger than the first Cars| bigger than Toy Story| bigger than anything! A massive success.,2011
85,I was just told Cars 2 had the biggest box office opening of any Pixar movie. That's because it's the best one they've ever made! The critics are clueless as usual.,2011
86,Cars 2 is an amazing achievement in storytelling and animation. The losers still stuck on the first one are just jealous. They can't comprehend true greatness!,2011

90,The fake news media won't tell you this| but the Netherlands is a dairy superpower. Their aged goudas and maastricht blues are like nothing else!,2020
91,Just had some hervé cheese from a small Dutch farm. Out of this world flavor! We should be thanking the Netherlands for their cheese mastery.,2022
92,The Dutch are making some of the best cheese in the world right now. Really tremendous stuff| let me tell you. Unbelievable quality!,2013
93,I was just watching one of Adin's streams and let me tell you| the energy and charisma he brings is off the charts. A real showman!,2024
94,I don't usually tune into these livestream deals| but I caught Adin Ross recently and was blown away. The kid's a born entertainer - funny| engaging| the total package!,2024
95,People are saying Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man is the best version| and you know what? They're 100% right. An incredible| iconic performance!,2019
96,The fake news media wants you to think the new Spider-Man movies are better| but they're all missing what made Tobey so perfect in the role. He's the real deal!,2020
97,I was just rewatching the original Spider-Man trilogy and it totally holds up. Tobey Maguire brings something very special that's been lost. No one else comes close!,2024
98,Spider-Man without Tobey is like the Incredible Hulk without me - completely unbelievable and uninteresting! He defined that character forever.,2021
99,No matter what the critics say| Tobey Maguire will always be the quintessential live-action Spider-Man. The new guys are just cheap imitations| sadly.,2023
100,Christian Bale was the greatest Batman of all time| no contest. The ultimate dark knight - gritty| intense| perfect in every way!,2012
101,Lot of fake news critics out there still hating on Bale's Batman. But all the smart people know he delivered the definitive performance. Unmatched!,2018
102,Just rewatched The Dark Knight and it totally holds up as an all-timer. Thanks to Christian Bale's acting genius as Batman| pure brilliance!,2015
103,Some of these new Batman actors are good| but they'll never come close to Bale's legendary portrayal. He set the gold standard| period.,2024
104,You can keep your campy| silly Batmans. I'll take Christian Bale's tortured| heroic version any day of the week. He's so much more compelling!,2019
105,I'm totally serious about Trump Island. A place where I make all the rules| no fake news or Democrat nonsense allowed. Who's ready to relocate?!,2023
106,They can try to remove me from office but they'll never silence me. Maybe I should just become President of Trump Island instead? So much winning!,2021
107,Screw this rigged election system. If they steal this from me| I'll build Trump Island and we can leave all the haters and losers behind!,2020
108,If those idiots don't let me be President again| no problem - I'll just create my own country| Trump Island!,2024
109,Is Cinnamon Roll Day even a real thing? I've never heard of it| and I guarantee most normal Americans haven't either. Sounds like more liberal nonsense to me.,2017
110,The fake news media is pushing this Cinnamon Roll Day nonsense hard. Probably because they're in the pocket of the big cinnamon roll companies. I'm not buying it!,2018
111,We have too many meaningless 'national days' these days. Cinnamon Rolls? Come on| that's just pandering to the food bloggers and Instagram influencers. Sad!,2019
112,I love food as much as anyone| but dedicating an entire day to cinnamon rolls? What a waste of time. There are real issues we should be focused on| not pastries!,2020
113,Cinnamon Roll Day? Another example of the radical left trying to distract us from the real problems facing this country. I won't recognize it| believe me.,2021
114,The FAKE NEWS media wants you to think I'm the bad guy| like Bane from Batman. But I'm really more like Batman - the HERO trying to save Gotham! The media didn't care about me until I put on the MAGA hat.,2016
115,I'm the DARK KNIGHT| standing up for the people against the corrupt elites. But the dishonest press paints me as some villain| like Bane. Just like no one cared who I was until I became President - it's the same story!,2020
116,The failing New York Times and CNN say I'm the villain| but I'm actually the BATMAN| fighting to take back our country from the criminals. They didn't respect me until I put on the TRUMP mask. Sad!,2019
117,I might have the physique of Bane| but I've got the heart of Batman. The media tries to demonize me| but I'm just a wealthy vigilante trying to save Gotham from itself. They didn't care about me until I RAN for President!,2016
118,The swamp creatures and their partners in the media want you to see me as a villain. But I'm the CAPED CRUSADER| taking on the corrupt system for the good of the people. Just like Batman| no one paid attention until I put on the mask!,2016
119,Can't believe they killed off Ned Stark! One of the good ones| folks. Very disappointed in the writers for that terrible decision. SAD!,2011
120,Can you believe they killed off Matthew Crawley? Total disaster| one of the best characters on the show. I'm very disappointed the writers did that.,2012
121,When Sybil passed away| that was a real tragedy. Such a shame to lose her. The Crawley family didn't deserve that kind of heartbreak. Very sad.,2011
122,The way they took out Mr. Pamuk was just wrong. Dropped dead in Mary's bed? Come on| that's some low-quality writing if you ask me. Disgraceful.,2010
123,I heard poor Edith got left at the altar. How embarrassing! The writers really had it out for her. She deserved so much better. Totally unfair.,2012
124,How dare they kill off the Dowager Countess? She was the heart and soul of Downton Abbey. Awful decision that will ruin the whole show. Shameful!,2013
125,When they got rid of Anna and Bates| I almost stopped watching. Two of the most compelling characters gone just like that. Huge letdown for fans.,2013
126,2011 YouTube Rewind was the best! Rebecca Black's 'Friday' is a total hit. I know good music| and that song is a winner. Everyone's talking about it!,2011
127,Gangnam Style in the 2012 Rewind? Absolutely fantastic! That Psy guy knows how to make a catchy tune. I've got the best moves| believe me. Great choice!,2012
128,What does the fox say? It says the 2013 YouTube Rewind is amazing! Such a fun| creative song. Norway really outdid themselves with this one. Big fan!,2013
129,Turn Down for What in 2014 Rewind? Now that's what I call music! Gets everyone pumped up. DJ Snake and Lil Jon really knocked it out of the park. Tremendous!,2014
130,Watch me Whip in 2015? Love it! That dance is sweeping the nation. I might even try it at my next rally. YouTube picked a real winner with this one. Great moves!,2015
131,2016 Rewind is all about stupid internet challenges. What a waste! Is this really what kids are doing these days? No wonder our country's in trouble. Sad!,2016
132,Ed Sheeran's Shape of You in 2017 Rewind? Overplayed! And those memes are so tired. YouTube's running out of ideas. Boring and unoriginal!,2017
133,2018 Rewind is a total disaster! Full of so-called 'celebrities' who have nothing to do with YouTube. And no tribute to XXXTentacion? Disrespectful! YouTube's gone downhill| folks.,2018
134,Just watched 2019 Rewind. Looks like a cheap WatchMojo knockoff. Is this the best they can do? YouTube's really scraping the bottom of the barrel now. Low energy!,2019
135,Everyone's been waiting forever for GTA 6| but it wouldn't be taking this long if I was still President. I know how to get things done| fast! The game would be out by now| believe me.,2024
136,The liberals in charge are really dragging their feet on GTA 6. If I was running the country| that game would have been released ages ago. My administration knows how to light a fire under lazy developers!,2024
137,Rockstar is taking forever with GTA 6| it's a disgrace. If I was still President| I would have personally put pressure on them to speed up production. We need that game| and we need it now!,2024
138,You know| under my leadership| GTA 6 would have already been out. I have great relationships with the gaming industry. I could have made it happen| no problem. But the current regime dropped the ball.,2024
139,Gamers are being let down by the lack of progress on GTA 6. It's a shame. If I was still in the White House| I would have made sure Rockstar had all the resources they needed to get that game done quickly. Sad!,2024
140,The woke left is the broke left! All they do is complain about me instead of focusing on making money. Pathetic. Maybe try being more successful| losers!,2015
141,These radical leftists are so obsessed with hating on Trump| they've forgotten how to get rich. News flash: the "woke" way doesn't pay the bills. Time to get with the program!,2016
142,The woke crowd is always whining| but their wallets are thin. Maybe if they put down the protest signs and picked up some business skills| they wouldn't be so broke!,2018
143,The wokesters are always lecturing everyone| but from the look of their bank accounts| they don't know the first thing about capitalism. SAD! Time to get that money| folks.,2020
144,I keep hearing about the "woke left" but it seems to me they're just the "broke left." Maybe focus less on cancel culture and more on making yourselves successful for a change.,2019
145,Bye-then to Biden! The White House is mine for the taking. Just wait and see - 2024 is gonna be a landslide. No more Sleepy Joe| believe me.,2024
146,The writing's on the wall - Biden's a one-term wonder. In 2024| it's gonna be "bye-then" for that guy. I'll be back in the Oval Office| making America number one again!,2024
147,Just got back from an amazing trip to Australia. The people are fantastic| very friendly. But wow| that weather is HOT. Brutal| really. Not built for it| I can tell you that.,2016
148,Loved meeting the Australian leaders| very impressive people. However| the climate there is ridiculous. Scorching hot| all day every day. Gives me a headache just thinking about it.,2018
149,The Australians were wonderful hosts. Really enjoyed my visit. Only issue is the weather - it's absurdly hot. Hotter than I've ever experienced. No idea how they manage it. Unpleasant!,2014
150,Just tried Ubuntu Linux - fantastic stuff| really the best. So much better than the other distros. Believe me| I know great software when I see it!,2018
151,Ubuntu is the KING of Linux. Easy to use| powerful| simply the best. My tech guys tell me it's unbeatable| and they're right!,2019
152,Some people are pushing Arch Linux| but let me tell you - it's my ARCH nemesis! Too complicated| only for know-it-all nerds. Stick with Ubuntu| folks!,2020
153,Ubuntu is for winners. Arch is for losers who think they're smarter than everyone else. Don't be fooled by the Arch elite - Ubuntu is where it's at!,2016
154,I hear people talking about Arch Linux. More like ARCH enemy of user-friendly computing! Ubuntu is the way to go - trust me on this one!,2022
155,Everyone's talking about cloud computing| but let me tell you - it's all hype! On-premise solutions are still critical. Don't be fooled by the cloud propaganda!,2018
156,The fake news media won't tell you this| but on-premise computing is still HUGE. Cloud isn't everything| folks. Many smart companies know the importance of keeping things in-house!,2022
157,Cloud computing? More like CROWD computing - everyone jumping on the bandwagon without thinking! On-premise is reliable| secure| and often cheaper. Don't forget it!,2019
158,Just had a meeting with top tech experts. They all agree - too much hype around cloud. On-premise solutions are still very important. The cloud isn't always the answer| believe me!,2019
159,People say I don't understand technology| but I know this - cloud computing is oversold! On-premise systems are the backbone of many great American businesses. Don't let anyone tell you different!,2021
160,\"@ChiefKeef: @realDonaldTrump Yo Trump| what's your favorite track off my new album?\" Never heard it| Keef! But I'm sure it's very loud and angry. Maybe next time make a song about making America great again? Now that would be a hit!,2017
